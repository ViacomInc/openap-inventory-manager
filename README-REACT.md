# React UI for OpenAP Inventory Manager

This is the UI package for the
[OpenAP Inventory Manager](https://github.com/ViacomInc/openap-inventory-manager).

If you'd like to skip the details, just use the [Quickstart](#quickstart).

This package is responsible for managing:

- _React Components_: A set of React components to build out the UI for managing
  inventory against the server.
- _Redux Functions_: Reducers, setters, and selectors for working with a Redux
  store to manager state in the UI.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to start is to use our Next.js template. It will create
everything you need to get up and running. The repo and instructions can be
found here:
